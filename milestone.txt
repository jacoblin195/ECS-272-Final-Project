We have pre-proccessed the dataset and transform it for d3 graph loading.

We implement a basic scatterplot for our system. The x-axis is the total number
of players from each country and the y-axis stands for the number of medals each
country won in an Olympic game. The size and color of dots indicates the male-
female ratio.

We also have a slider bar at the bottom for switching from year to year. We plan
to implement a button that can auto-play the progress to see the long-term
pattern.

As for the bubble set contour, we haven't start implementing it. We are in the
process of understanding the algorithm and will implement it on the scatterplot
later on.
